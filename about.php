		<h2>How we do it?</h2>

		<p>To become a volunteer you must <a href="register.php">sign up</a>. After signing up you will have access to all volunteering events. If one seems to suit your prefrences you can confirm your attendance.</p>
		<p>For each event we will have someone from our team show up to coordinate and verify that everyone that confirmed their attendance has showed up.</p>
		
		<h2>Why we do it?</h2>
		<p>We believe that by working together and lending a hand, we can make a difference. Community is all about looking out for those around us.</br></br>VolunTimi opens the door to those who need help to be helped, and those who want to help to have the possibility to help.
